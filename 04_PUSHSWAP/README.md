## 04_PUSHSWAP

> This project aim to deeply understand sorting algorithm. We have to use the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you'll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one most appropriate solution for an optmized data sorting.

First, i have calculated the median and if the number is upper than the median, i push to the stack b while i'm decrementing the median.
Then, i used an array of index to calculate how much it cost to push the first number of the stack b to
