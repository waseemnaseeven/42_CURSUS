| [CPP04](https://github.com/waseemnaseeven/42_CURSUS/tree/main/14_PISCINECPP/CPP04) |C++| This module is designed to understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP.|
| [CPP03](https://github.com/waseemnaseeven/42_CURSUS/tree/main/14_PISCINECPP/CPP03) |C++| This module is designed to understand Inheritance in CPP. |
| [CPP02](https://github.com/waseemnaseeven/42_CURSUS/tree/main/14_PISCINECPP/CPP02) |C++| This module is designed to understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP. |
| [CPP01](https://github.com/waseemnaseeven/42_CURSUS/tree/main/14_PISCINECPP/CPP01) |C++| This module is designed to understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP. |
| [CPP00](https://github.com/waseemnaseeven/42_CURSUS/tree/main/14_PISCINECPP/CPP00) |C++| This first module of C++ is designed to understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming! |
